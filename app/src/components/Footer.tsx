        <b>Metro Madness</b> is a weekly single-elimination tournament that pits
        unsuspecting NYC subway trains against one another in a contest of
        punctuality. Games start every weekday at 5pm. Each game is a
        competition between two <i>individual</i> trains from two different
        services. The first train that departs from a terminal station after 5pm
        becomes the representative for its service. For example, if the Q and
        the 3 are competing, then the first Q train to depart from either 96 St
        or Coney Island-Stillwell Av will compete against the first 3 train to
        depart from either Harlem 148 St or New Lots Av. The &quot;finish
        line&quot; is a number of stops, which will be the same for both
        competing trains. The train which is the <i>least delayed</i> after
        passing that many stops wins and proceeds to the next round. This
